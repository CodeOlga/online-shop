    album: "Rumors" ,
    searchTerm: "rock" ,
    overview: `Rumours is the kind of album that transcends its origins and reputation, entering the realm of legend -- it's an album that simply exists outside of criticism and outside of its time, even if it thoroughly captures its era. Prior to this LP, Fleetwood Mac were moderately successful, but here they turned into a full-fledged phenomenon, with Rumours becoming the biggest-selling pop album to date. While its chart success was historic, much of the legend surrounding the record is born from the group's internal turmoil. Unlike most bands, Fleetwood Mac in the mid-'70s were professionally and romantically intertwined, with no less than two couples in the band, but as their professional career took off, the personal side unraveled. Bassist John McVie and his keyboardist/singer wife Christine McVie filed for divorce as guitarist/vocalist Lindsey Buckingham and vocalist Stevie Nicks split, with Stevie running to drummer Mick Fleetwood, unbeknown to the rest of the band. These personal tensions fueled nearly every song on Rumours, which makes listening to the album a nearly voyeuristic experience. You're eavesdropping on the bandmates singing painful truths about each other, spreading nasty lies and rumors and wallowing in their grief, all in the presence of the person who caused the heartache. Everybody loves gawking at a good public breakup, but if that was all that it took to sell a record, Richard and Linda Thompson's Shoot Out the Lights would be multi-platinum. No, what made Rumours an unparalleled blockbuster is the quality of the music. Once again masterminded by producer/songwriter/guitarist Buckingham, Rumours is an exceptionally musical piece of work -- he toughens Christine McVie and softens Nicks, adding weird turns to accessibly melodic works, which gives the universal themes of the songs haunting resonance. It also cloaks the raw emotion of the lyrics in deceptively palatable arrangements that made a tune as wrecked and tortured as "Go Your Own Way" an anthemic hit. But that's what makes Rumours such an enduring achievement -- it turns private pain into something universal. Some of these songs may be too familiar, whether through their repeated exposure on FM radio or their use in presidential campaigns, but in the context of the album, each tune, each phrase regains its raw, immediate emotional power -- which is why Rumours touched a nerve upon its 1977 release, and has since transcended its era to be one of the greatest, most compelling pop albums of all time.

    overview: `Not to be confused with 1981's Greatest Hits, 1992's Classic Queen, or 1992's reissue of 1981's Greatest Hits, 2004's Greatest Hits is a superb 20-track sampler of Queen's best, eclipsing all of the aforementioned packages. Excepting their late-career singles, this set spans the British group's tenure, from 1974's "Seven Seas of Rhye" to a 1984 live performance of "Under Pressure." In between are a host of the ambitious, distinctive, and often brilliant songs on which Queen built their name. The multi-part "Bohemian Rhapsody," with its lilting melodies, layered operatic vocals, studio trickery, and heavy metal breakdowns, epitomizes the group's recombinant aesthetic and cheeky flair. The spare, disco-funk of "Another One Bites the Dust" and the breezy, music hall-like "Killer Queen" should be familiar to anyone within earshot of a radio in the '70s and '80s. The givens -- the camp-rockabilly "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" and perennial stadium anthems "We Will Rock You" and "We Are the Champions" -- are here, but surprises like the exuberant "Don't Stop Me Now" give a well-rounded perspective on the band. With Brian May's unique guitar sound and Freddie Mercury's brash, personality-filled vocal performances, Queen was one of the most original and popular acts in rock history, and Greatest Hits brings the group's peak moments together on one remarkable disc. [In 2016, Greatest Hits was reissued in a two-LP edition half-speed mastered at Abbey Road Studios and pressed on 180-gram vinyl.] ~ Anthony Tognazzini`,

    artist: "Miles Davis",
    album: "Round About Midnight" ,
    searchTerm: "jazz" ,
    overview: `Given that 'Round About Midnight was Miles Davis' debut Columbia recording, it was both a beginning and an ending. Certainly the beginning of his recording career with the label that issued most if not all of his important recordings; and the recording debut of an exciting new band that had within its ranks Philly Joe Jones, Paul Chambers, pianist Red Garland, and an all but unknown tenor player named John Coltrane. The title track was chosen because of its unique rendition with a muted trumpet, and debuted at the Newport Jazz Festival the summer before to a thunderous reception. The date was also an ending of sorts because by the time of the album's release, Davis had already broken up the band, which re-formed with Cannonball Adderley a year later as a sextet, but it was a tense year. Musically, this sound is as unusual and as beautiful as it was when issued in 1956. Davis had already led the charge through two changes in jazz -- both cool jazz and hard bop -- and was beginning to move in another direction here that wouldn't be defined for another two years. Besides the obvious lyrical and harmonic beauty of "Round About Midnight" that is arguably its definitive version even over Monk's own, there are the edges of Charlie Parker's "Au Leu-Cha" with its Bluesology leaping from every chord change in Red Garland's left hand. Coltrane's solo here too is notable for its stark contrast to Davis' own: he chooses an angular tack where he finds the heart of the mode and plays a melody in harmonic counterpoint to the changes but never sounds outside. Cole Porter's "All of You" has Davis quoting from Louis Armstrong's "Basin Street Blues" in his solo that takes out the tune, and Coltrane has never respected a melody so much. But it's in "Bye-Bye Blackbird" that we get to hear the band gel as a unit, beginning with Davis playing through the melody, muted and sweet, slightly flatted out until he reaches the harmony on the refrain and begins his solo on a high note. Garland is doing more than comping in the background; he's slipping chord shapes into those interval cracks and shifting them as the rhythm section keeps "soft time." When Coltrane moves in for his break, rather than Davis' spare method, he smatters notes quickly all though the melodic body of the tune and Garland has to compensate harmonically, moving the mode and tempo up a notch until his own solo can bring it back down again. Which he does with a gorgeous all-blues read of the tune utilizing first one hand and then both hands to create fat harmonic chords to bring Davis back in to close it out. It's breathtaking how seamless it all is. There's little else to say except that 'Round About Midnight is among the most essential of Davis' Columbia recordings.

    album: "Ziggy Stardust" ,
    searchTerm: "rock" ,
    overview: `Borrowing heavily from Marc Bolan's glam rock and the future shock of A Clockwork Orange, David Bowie reached back to the heavy rock of The Man Who Sold the World for The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. Constructed as a loose concept album about an androgynous alien rock star named Ziggy Stardust, the story falls apart quickly, yet Bowie's fractured, paranoid lyrics are evocative of a decadent, decaying future, and the music echoes an apocalyptic, nuclear dread. Fleshing out the off-kilter metallic mix with fatter guitars, genuine pop songs, string sections, keyboards, and a cinematic flourish, Ziggy Stardust is a glitzy array of riffs, hooks, melodrama, and style and the logical culmination of glam. Mick Ronson plays with a maverick flair that invigorates rockers like "Suffragette City," "Moonage Daydream," and "Hang Onto Yourself," while "Lady Stardust," "Five Years," and "Rock 'n' Roll Suicide" have a grand sense of staged drama previously unheard of in rock & roll. And that self-conscious sense of theater is part of the reason why Ziggy Stardust sounds so foreign. Bowie succeeds not in spite of his pretensions but because of them, and Ziggy Stardust -- familiar in structure, but alien in performance -- is the first time his vision and execution met in such a grand, sweeping fashion.

    album: "Kind of Blue" ,
    searchTerm: "jazz" ,
    overview: `Kind of Blue isn't merely an artistic highlight for Miles Davis, it's an album that towers above its peers, a record generally considered as the definitive jazz album, a universally acknowledged standard of excellence. Why does Kind of Blue posses such a mystique? Perhaps because this music never flaunts its genius. It lures listeners in with the slow, luxurious bassline and gentle piano chords of "So What." From that moment on, the record never really changes pace -- each tune has a similar relaxed feel, as the music flows easily. Yet Kind of Blue is more than easy listening. It's the pinnacle of modal jazz -- tonality and solos build from the overall key, not chord changes, giving the music a subtly shifting quality. All of this doesn't quite explain why seasoned jazz fans return to this record even after they've memorized every nuance. They return because this is an exceptional band -- Miles, Coltrane, Bill Evans, Cannonball Adderley, Paul Chambers, Jimmy Cobb -- one of the greatest in history, playing at the peak of its power. As Evans said in the original liner notes for the record, the band did not play through any of these pieces prior to recording. Davis laid out the themes before the tape rolled, and then the band improvised. The end results were wondrous and still crackle with vitality. Kind of Blue works on many different levels. It can be played as background music, yet it amply rewards close listening. It is advanced music that is extraordinarily enjoyable. It may be a stretch to say that if you don't like Kind of Blue, you don't like jazz -- but it's hard to imagine it as anything other than a cornerstone of any jazz collection.

    searchTerm: "hip-hop" ,
    overview: `To Pimp a Butterfly's proper and oft-biblical follow-up arrived on Good Friday, 13 months after untitled unmastered., an intermediary release that eclipsed the best work of most contemporary artists. If Kendrick Lamar felt pressure to continue living up to his previous output, there's no evidence on DAMN. He's too occupied tracing the spectrum of his mental states, from "boxin' demons" to "flex on swole," questioning and reveling in his affluence, castigating and celebrating his bloodline, humble enough to relate his vulnerabilities, assured enough to proclaim "Ain't none of y'all fuckin' with the flow." Throughout, he intensely examines most of the seven deadly sins, aware all along that his existence is threatened by anyone who objects to the color of his skin or clothes -- or, in the case of the blind stranger who shoots him during the album's opener, nothing that is apparent. Compared to the maximum-capacity, genre-twisting vastness and winding narratives of Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City and To Pimp a Butterfly, DAMN. on the surface seems like a comparatively simple rap album that demands less from the listener. There's relative concision in the track titles and material, and a greater emphasis on commercial sounds -- such as Mike WiLL's lean and piano-laced trap beat for the strong-arming "HUMBLE.," Lamar's first Top Ten pop hit, and a couple productions that are merely functional backdrops lacking distinction. In a way, however, DAMN. is just as lavish and singular as the preceding albums, its quantity and weight of thoughts and connected concepts condensed into a considerably tighter space. It contains some of Lamar's best writing and performances, revealing his evolving complexity and versatility as a soul-baring lyricist and dynamic rapper. Although it's occasionally distorted, stretched, smeared, and reversed to compelling and imagination-fueling effect, his voice is at its most affecting in its many untreated forms. Take "FEAR.," in which he switches between echoing hot-blooded parental threats to enumerating, with a 40-acre stare, various death scenarios. His storytelling hits an astonishing new high on "Duckworth," the album's finale. Over ethereal funk sewn by 9th Wonder, Lamar details a potentially tragic encounter between his father and future Top Dawg CEO Anthony Tiffith -- and the conditions leading to it -- that occurred long before Kung Fu Kenny was known as K. Dot. [DAMN. was also released in a two-LP vinyl edition.]`,

For all the excesses detailed by the band's biographers, it's a fact that leaders Don Henley and Glenn Frey ran a tight ship, crafting songs, albums, and the band's stage show for maximum sonic and emotional impact. In 1976, following four increasingly sophisticated and successful albums of unassailable country rock, Henley and Frey crafted Hotel California, the album of their career. They put to good use both the band's plangent lead guitarist, Don Felder, and rock vet Joe Walsh to give the Eagles a new, harder-rocking authority ("Life in the Fast Lane"), without giving up a certain chamber-rock classicism ("Wasted Time"). And then there's the celebrated title song, the hit "New Kid in Town," and Henley and Frey's ambitious summation, "The Last Resort."`,

Songs in the Key of Life is his most balanced synergy of spirituality, romance, and politics. Musically, Wonder combines immediate melodies with more complex orchestration than he had on previous albums. Triumphant horns introduce the euphoric "Sir Duke," while a funky organ melody underpins the Grammy-winning single "I Wish." Meanwhile, simple songs such as "Knocks Me off My Feet" and "Joy Inside My Tears" are as emotionally stunning as grander affairs like the big band celebration "Another Star" and the jazzy "Summer Soft." The reissue also includes four songs that originally accompanied the album on a 45 insert, including "Ebony Eyes," an homage to African-American women, and the sexy, guitar funk classic "All Day Sucker." The significance of this recording to soul music is immeasurable -- Songs in the Key of Life is an incomparable tribute to love, spirit, justice, and the joy of life itself.`,

    album: "Let It Be" ,
    searchTerm: "rock" ,
    overview: `The only Beatles album to occasion negative, even hostile reviews, there are few other rock records as controversial as Let It Be. First off, several facts need to be explained: although released in May 1970, this was not their final album, but largely recorded in early 1969, way before Abbey Road. Phil Spector was enlisted in early 1970 to do some post-production mixing and overdubs, but he did not work with the band as a unit. And, although his use of strings has generated much criticism, by and large he left the original performances to stand as is: only "The Long and Winding Road" and (to a lesser degree) "Across the Universe" and "I Me Mine" get the Wall of Sound treatment. The main problem was that the material wasn't uniformly strong, and that the Beatles themselves were in fairly lousy moods due to intergroup tension. All that said, the album is on the whole underrated, even discounting the fact that a substandard Beatles record is better than almost any other group's best work. McCartney in particular offers several gems: the gospel-ish "Let It Be," which has some of his best lyrics; "Get Back," one of his hardest rockers; and the melodic "The Long and Winding Road," ruined by Spector's heavy-handed overdubs. The folky "Two of Us," with John and Paul harmonizing together, was also a highlight. Most of the rest of the material, by contrast, was going through the motions to some degree, although there are some good moments of straight hard rock in "I've Got a Feeling" and "Dig a Pony." As flawed and bumpy as it is, it's an album well worth having, as when the Beatles were in top form here, they were as good as ever. [Let It Be was remastered and released on vinyl in 2012.]`,

    overview: `Dr. Dre, a.k.a. Andre Young, may not be a great rapper, but the skillful producer put his mark on hip-hop with a string of classic albums culminating in this "solo" debut. Dre started off in the right place at the right time. A member of N.W.A. and producer of their most infamous recordings, Straight Outta Compton and Niggaz 4 Life, Dre split with Eazy E and began working on his own material, often with guests rapping. After dropping his debut single, "Deep Cover" (the title track from the same-named movie), he responded with his opus The Chronic. Dre took gangsta rap's typically frenetic backing and slowed it down to George Clinton–esque R&B; he smoothed it out by adding touches of lite jazz, and the G-Funk sound was born. While it irrevocably altered the hip-hop landscape upon its release in 1992, The Chronic is equally notable for launching the career of Snoop Doggy Dogg, who appears on several key tracks, including "Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang." Snoop would go on to a notable career of his own, kicked off by his Dre-produced debut, Doggystyle, but his irresistible presence on The Chronic only underscores Dre's formidable skills as a producer -- which would later play no small role the arrival and development of a young white rapper named Eminem.`,

    searchTerm: "hip-hop" ,
    overview: `Maybe it was his time in prison, or maybe it was simply his signing with Suge Knight's Death Row label. Whatever the case, 2Pac re-emerged hardened and hungry with All Eyez on Me, the first double-disc album of original material in hip-hop history. With all the controversy surrounding him, 2Pac seemingly wanted to throw down a monumental epic whose sheer scope would make it an achievement of itself. But more than that, it's also an unabashed embrace of the gangsta lifestyle, backing off the sober self-recognition of Me Against the World. Sure, there are a few reflective numbers and dead-homiez tributes, but they're much more romanticized this time around. All Eyez on Me is 2Pac the thug icon in all his brazen excess, throwing off all self-control and letting it all hang out -- even if some of it would have been better kept to himself. In that sense, it's an accurate depiction of what made him such a volatile and compelling personality, despite some undeniable filler. On the plus side, this is easily the best production he's ever had on record, handled mostly by Johnny J (notably on the smash "How Do U Want It") and Dat Nigga Daz; Dr. Dre also contributes another surefire single in "California Love" (which, unfortunately, is present only as a remix, not the original hit version). Both hits are on the front-loaded first disc, which would be a gangsta classic in itself; other highlights include the anthemic Snoop Dogg duet "2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted," "All About U" (with the required Nate Dogg-sung hook), and "I Ain't Mad at Cha," a tribute to old friends who've gotten off the streets. Despite some good moments, the second disc is slowed by filler and countless guest appearances, plus a few too many thug-lovin' divas crooning their loyalty. Erratic though it may be, All Eyez on Me is nonetheless carried off with the assurance of a legend in his own time, and it stands as 2Pac's magnum opus.`,

    overview: `Arguably, the greatest R&B record ever made, WHAT'S GOING ON was only reluctantly released by the storied Motown label. The recording marked an extreme departure from the label's usual method of tightly controlled collections of singles. Instead, Gaye, inspired by the return of his brother from Vietnam, created a 35 minute suite of lushly detailed pieces that blended social commentary and spirituality. Rather than the slick, driving sound of Motown singles, WHAT'S GOING ON featured subdued basslines and a languorous groove that would later become a staple in jazz-funk. The recording produced three major hits, "Inner City Blues (Makes Me Wanna Holler)", the title track, and "Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)"; in addition, Diana Ross covered "Save the Children" and Aretha Franklin did "Wholy Holy." The album inspired other R&B artists to take a similar approach to producing their own work and creating more substantial documents. Gaye went on to create both hit singles and great extended works, proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that he was both a hitmaker and an artist.`,

    overview: `When the Doors emerged in 1967, the world of rock had never seen anything quite like them before. Their closest relatives were probably New York's Velvet Underground, who also mixed poetry with decidedly anti-flower-power rock. But where the VU came from a gritty, more urban context, the Doors were influenced by the freewheeling approach of '60s West Coast psychedelia -- mostly in that they were a reaction against it. On the band's eponymous debut, a dark, lyrical sensibility stands at odds with the LSD-tinted visions of the Grateful Dead et al., but the depths to which the Doors' penetrating, unsettling visions were explored could only have been possible in a community set free by the psychedelic revolution. With their lack of a bass player, Ray Manzarek's semiclassical keyboard flourishes, John Densmore's jazzy, impressionistic drumming, and Jim Morrison's surreal, iconoclastic lyrics, the Doors were virtually without precedent in rock 'n' roll. On The Doors, they used blues (Willie Dixon's "Back Door Man"), pop ("Light My Fire"), and even Brecht-Weill art song ("Alabama Song") as vehicles to express their unique sentiments. While the catchy "Light My Fire" was the band's breakthrough hit, it is the groundbreaking 11-minute epic "The End" that showcases the band in all its improvisational, poetic glory.`,

    overview: `In 1958, John Coltrane had yet to take the modal post-bop plunge. He was still a hard bopper, although his "sheets of sound" solos were certainly among the most interesting, creative, and distinctive that bop had to offer in the late '50s. Stardust contains some highlights of two bop-oriented Coltrane dates from 1958: one is a July 11 session with trumpeter/flugelhornist Wilbur Harden, pianist Red Garland, bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Jimmy Cobb, the other is a December 26 session with Garland, Chambers, trumpeter Freddie Hubbard, and drummer Art Taylor. At both sessions, Coltrane's playing is quite engaging. He is a lyrical, expressive ballad player on "Then I'll Be Tired of You," "Stardust," and "Time After Time," but he swings fast and aggressively on "Love Thy Neighbor" (the only track on this 39-minute program that isn't a ballad). And at both sessions, Coltrane is well served by Garland's piano and Chambers' bass. When Coltrane was playing alongside those jazzmen in Miles Davis' 1955-1957 quintet, he enjoyed a strong rapport with both of them -- and that rapport wasn't any less strong in 1958. It is no coincidence that Prestige's A&R department united Coltrane with Garland and Chambers so often; Prestige knew how compatible all of them were. Although not quite essential, Stardust paints a consistently attractive picture of Coltrane's 1958 output. [Stardust was re-released on LP in 2014.]`,

Here was Amy, obviously a major vocal talent, but also nearly superheroically self-destructive. Unlike her hometown audience, we never got to hear that expressive, jazz-indebted voice outside of the carnival of tawdriness that has followed Winehouse since Back to Black surfaced, that is, apart from the cartoon. But our gain is an artist fully formed. The album is smartly conceived, and as lean as the anorectic-seeming Winehouse would herself unfortunately become. Thanks goes to the production team: Salaam Remi, whose hip-hop record meshes perfectly with the increasingly interesting Motown fixations of Mark Ronson. The pair devise a musical space tailor-made to Winehouse's contemporary take on the '50s bad girl that was already apparent in her tart lyrics and wild bouffant 'do. Honking saxophones, tambourines and hand-claps (most from the busy Brooklyn studio band the Daptones) herald a sound that's been attempted before but never fully succeeded. And that's where Amy comes in, with that wonderfully singular voice, equally at home crooning pillow talk as gutter talk, each surprisingly, shockingly delivered verse a lot more interesting than her tabloid exploits would warrant. Here's hoping she finds a way to top one of 2007's best albums.`,
